# Emotion-recognition-Calssification-
 Evaluation This class project, is similar to the MNIST type recognition tasks, but instead you will have to classify images of people's faces to detect their emotion.
 
This task involves using various machine learning algorithms to identify the emotions of individuals from their facial expressions. To train the algorithm, a labelled dataset of emotions is required, and once trained, the algorithm can classify new data into one of several emotional categories. There are various models and methods used for emotion recognition classification, including standard machine learning (KNN) and deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), dense nets, LSTM, 3-layer CNN, DCNN, among others.

In this emotional recognition competition, we gain knowledge on detecting emotions on human faces and utilizing different models for the same purpose. Identifying facial expressions can be tricky as it poses challenges related to model performance, labeled data, tuning, and data augmentation. Further, it is crucial to assess the efficiency of various models using evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, and cross- validation techniques to avoid overfitting the training set.
